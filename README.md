# Stock-Market-Prediction
In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company.
The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes
predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values.
Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The paper
focuses on the use of Regression and LSTM based Machine learning to predict stock values. Factors
considered are open, close, low, high and volume. The stock market is a dynamic and complex financial
environment where investors seek to make informed decisions to maximize their returns. Predicting
stock prices and market trends has been a challenging and important task. Various ML algorithms,
including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks,
are applied to the dataset. The models are trained and tested on historical data, and their performance is
evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). The results show that ML models can provide valuable insights and predictions
for stock market trends, enabling investors to make more informed decisions.
